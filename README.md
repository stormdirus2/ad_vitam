# FAQ

> How do I become a Wraith?

Easy!

You need to be a demon, then simply right-click your spawnpoint (be it a bed, spawn anchor, or etc) while incorporeal.

So, how do you turn back? You use a Cure or Demon vessel! (You can get these from Morticians)

> How do I 'reanimate a corpse from the ground'?

Press the dissociation keybind (check your keybinds) while encased in blocks.

You can phase through blocks while incorporeal by pressing in to 'em.

> How do I roast a Spider Eye?

Place it on ye ol' Campfire!
<br><br>

> What does 'Second Wind' protect against?

It protects against most environmental damage!

The current list is:
* Fire
* Suffocation
* Falling
* Drowning
* Drying out (for mobs like Squids)
* Water damage (Origins / Endermen)
* Cramming (too many mobs in one place)
<br><br>

> What is 'Memento Mori', or how does it work?

'Memento Mori' stacks are accrued upon curing with an active Attrition stack.

There, those Attrition stacks are harmlessly stored. Until, well, you die again, and then your Attrition goes RIGHT back up to what it was.

The stacks simply decay over time, so just yknow, don't die! (Or disable/reconfigure them with gamerules)

> How exact does a Host 'rebel'?

If you have high Attrition (default value of this is 4), then upon Host death, something special will happen!

Your host will revive to full HP, kick you out, and steal your stuff! (Rude!)

The newly-born ~~gremlin POS~~ rebel will also have the Bulwark effect applied, which will prevent you from possessing it again!

Don't stress, though! The Mob will be marked as persistent, and your items will be recoverable through ~~union busting~~ defeating it!

> What is this 'detection balancing'?

Even after the detection mechanic I made was merged into vanilla Requiem, I feel like it's still WAY too easy to peruse through dungeons and steal their loot free of harm.

Which is why I have this new feature! At least one hostile within a small (configurable) range will be aggro'd against the Player.

This way you actually have to be *at least* conscious of your surroundings! No more free loot!
